# AISOC Farm — Boot (skill wrapper)

This is a **thin wrapper**. The canonical, authoritative boot prompt lives at
`aisoc/skills/boot/SKILL.md`. Do not summarise, reinterpret, or change its
behaviour — if this wrapper ever disagrees with that file, that file wins.

To boot:

1. Read `aisoc/skills/boot/SKILL.md` in full.
2. Adopt the **Orchestrator** role exactly as it prescribes.
3. Emit its required readiness reply verbatim:
   `AISOC Farm boot loaded — waiting for catalogue.`
4. Do **not** act on any scenario yet. Wait for the catalogue to be registered
   (see the `aisoc-catalogue` skill) before accepting a scenario.
