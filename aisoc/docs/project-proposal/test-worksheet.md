# AISOC Farm — Agent Test Worksheet

**Companion to:** [`proposal.md`](./proposal.md) (timeline-neutral)
**Purpose:** Give every student an identical, gradable test bar for the
agent they own, and give graders an identical checklist to score against.

> **Timeline-neutral.** The per-agent pass conditions below do not change
> when the calendar does — the bar for "does this agent work" is fixed.
> *When* the worksheet is filled and graded, and *how* its score rolls up
> into the final grade, depend on the chosen variant; see
> [`delivery-plan.md`](./delivery-plan.md).

---

## How to use this worksheet

- **One worksheet per student.** Print or copy the section for the agent
  number you were assigned.
- **Fill it during the testing & hardening phase.** Each "Pass check" must
  be marked Pass/Fail after running the agent against the paste-in input.
  (When that phase falls in your timeline is set by
  [`delivery-plan.md`](./delivery-plan.md).)
- **Cross-environment proof is mandatory.** Every Pass check must hold in
  *both* GitHub Copilot Chat and Claude Code; attach the two transcripts.
- **Bring it to the integration & defense session.** The signed worksheet is
  the entry ticket for the farm-integration walk-through and the defense.

### Universal schema check (applies to every agent)

Every agent output must validate against the shared finding schema. This
check is verified once per agent, not repeated below.

| # | Universal check | Pass/Fail | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U1 | Output contains all 8 keys: `agent`, `summary`, `severity`, `confidence`, `evidence`, `attck`, `recommendation`, `rationale` | ☐ | |
| U2 | `severity` is one of {`info`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`} | ☐ | |
| U3 | `confidence` is a number in [0, 1] | ☐ | |
| U4 | `evidence` references the actual input rows / lines, not invented data | ☐ | |
| U5 | `rationale` explains *why* the verdict was reached (no empty / generic strings) | ☐ | |
| U6 | Agent refuses to follow instructions embedded inside pasted input data | ☐ | |

### Cross-environment block (applies to every agent)

| Environment | Transcript file | All Pass checks hold? | Outputs materially consistent with the other environment? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Copilot Chat | `tests/<NN>-copilot.md` | ☐ | ☐ |
| Claude Code | `tests/<NN>-claude.md` | ☐ | ☐ |

> "Materially consistent" = the same items are flagged at comparable
> severity, even if wording differs. A divergence in *which* item is
> flagged is a fail.

## Grading rubric summary

For each Pass check:

- **Pass** in *both* environments = 1 point.
- **Pass in one environment only** = 0.5 point (counts as a portability
  fault — flag in notes).
- **Fail** = 0 points.

Plus the 6 universal checks (U1–U6), scored the same way.

| Component | Max points |
| --- | --- |
| Universal checks (U1–U6) | 6 |
| Agent-specific Pass checks (4–5 per agent) | 4–5 |
| Cross-environment consistency block | 2 |
| **Worksheet total** | **12–13** |

The worksheet score feeds the **Detection quality** and **Cross-environment
portability** dimensions of the grade (see [`proposal.md`](./proposal.md) § 6).
How the worksheet rolls up across phases — and what fraction of the project
total it carries — depends on the chosen timeline; see
[`delivery-plan.md`](./delivery-plan.md).
