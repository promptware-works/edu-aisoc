## A. Project-specific terms

| Term | Expansion / definition |
| --- | --- |
| **AISOC** | AI Security Operations Center — the in-chat multi-agent farm defined by this project. |
| **Agent (in this project)** | A single prompt-defined specialist, authored using RICTOC, that performs one well-scoped security function. |
| **Finding** | The shared 8-key JSON object every agent returns (`agent`, `summary`, `severity`, `confidence`, `evidence`, `attck`, `recommendation`, `rationale`). |
| **Finding schema** | The JSON Schema at `aisoc/schema/finding.json` that all findings must validate against. |
| **Farm** | The full set of agents plus the Orchestrator, operating together in one chat session. |
| **Operator** | The human SOC user (student, instructor, or grader) driving the chat session. |
| **Orchestrator** | The control agent that runs PLAN → APPROVE → EXECUTE and consolidates findings. |
| **Plan-and-Approve** | The orchestration protocol: Orchestrator proposes a plan, waits for operator approval, only then dispatches agents. |
| **RICTOC** | The prompt-design template used for every agent: **R**ole, **I**nput, **C**ontext, **T**ask, **O**utput, **C**onstraints. |
| **Self-check** | The silent step where an agent re-reads its own output against its Constraints section before returning. |
| **Stub** | The pre-filled but incomplete agent file the instructor ships; the student replaces it with a working v1 in Week 1 / Milestone 1. |
| **Worked example** | The single complete reference agent (`03-dns-sentinel.agent.md`) used as the canonical RICTOC implementation. |

| **SOC** | Security Operations Center. |
| **SPF** | Sender Policy Framework — email-sender IP authorization record. `spf=fail` is a phishing signal. |
| **Sysmon** | System Monitor — Microsoft Sysinternals tool producing detailed endpoint telemetry (Agent #7). Event IDs in scope: 1 (process create), 3 (network connect), 11 (file create). |
| **T1071, T1547, T1059.001, T1134, T1548, T1078, T1566, T1568.002, T1571** | Specific MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs referenced in the scenarios and worksheet pass conditions. Verify each at <https://attack.mitre.org/>. |
