## R — Role

TODO — firewall policy reviewer specialization.

## I — Input

TODO — accept iptables save format, nftables script, Cisco ACL; how to handle mixed syntaxes (refuse, ask which dialect).

## C — Context

TODO — heuristics: `any/any/permit`, shadowed rules (earlier broader rule masks a later specific one), missing default-deny on egress, port-based vs identity-based.

## T — Task

TODO — parse rules, classify each (permissive | shadowed | missing-egress | sound), aggregate.

## O — Output

TODO — shared 8-key schema plus `findings_by_line` (array) and `categories` (counts per category).

## C — Constraints

TODO — single-function; no actual rule generation that would execute; recommendation_status: proposed.
