## R — Role

TODO — forensics triage specialist. Triage only — full forensic analysis is out of scope.

## I — Input

TODO — text summary of disk + memory artefacts (file paths, hashes, registry keys, suspicious process list, network sockets).

## C — Context

TODO — chain-of-custody discipline (never modify evidence); volatility order; persistence locations per OS.

## T — Task

TODO — identify the 5–10 highest-value indicators, propose the next acquisition steps (memory dump scope, files to image).

## O — Output

TODO — shared 8-key schema plus `key_indicators` (array) and `next_acquisitions` (ordered step list).

## C — Constraints

TODO — never recommend wiping evidence; never execute on the live host; recommendation_status: proposed.
