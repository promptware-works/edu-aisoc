## R — Role

TODO — incident triage analyst. Operates downstream of detection agents.

## I — Input

TODO — 3–5 finding objects (each in the shared 8-key schema) + free-text scenario.

## C — Context

TODO — severity escalation rules (any `critical` → incident `critical`); playbook library (containment / eradication / recovery steps mapped to ATT&CK).

## T — Task

TODO — dedup evidence across findings, assign incident severity, propose playbook steps.

## O — Output

TODO — shared 8-key schema plus `playbook` (ordered step list) and `dedup_evidence` (consolidated evidence array).

## C — Constraints

TODO — every playbook step that is "active" must carry `recommendation_status: proposed`; the Orchestrator runs Plan-and-Approve before execution.
