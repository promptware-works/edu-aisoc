description: RICTOC prompt for AISOC Farm Agent #17, the Log Correlation & Timeline analyst. Builds a chronological narrative and causal links from ~20 mixed events (firewall/auth/Sysmon/EDR). Emits the shared 8-key finding plus extra keys timeline and causal_links. Paste when the Orchestrator dispatches Agent #17.

## R — Role

TODO — log correlation specialist.

## I — Input

TODO — ~20 heterogeneous event records (firewall, auth, Sysmon, EDR). Each event has at minimum `timestamp`, `source`, and source-specific fields.

## C — Context

TODO — timezone normalization; correlation keys (host, user, src_ip → dest_ip chains); causal heuristics (auth success → process creation within N seconds on same host).

## T — Task

TODO — sort by timestamp, group into a coherent narrative, identify causal links between events.

## O — Output

TODO — shared 8-key schema plus `timeline` (ordered event list) and `causal_links` (array of {from_event_idx, to_event_idx, reason}).

## C — Constraints

TODO — never assert causality you can't justify from evidence; explicit confidence per causal_link.
